# CMCS_Prototype
CMCS - Claims Management System Prototype
This repository contains the source code for the Claims Management System (CMCS), a web-based prototype designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing expense claims for lecturers. The application provides a simple, secure, and intuitive platform for both lecturers and administrators.

Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for both lecturers and administrators.

Role-Based Access Control: Differentiates between a lecturer and an admin, restricting access to sensitive pages.

Personalized Lecturer Dashboard: Lecturers can submit new claims and view a real-time history of all their past claims.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators have a centralized view of all claims, with the ability to approve or reject them with a single click.

Responsive UI: A clean, modern, and mobile-responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS.

Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core MVC: The foundational framework for the application's architecture.

C#: The primary programming language used for the backend logic.

Entity Framework Core: An object-relational mapper (ORM) for efficient database interaction.

SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database used to store user and claim data.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
